# JAVA-ML
Implementing a small ML and DL library in pure java from scratch.

# Implemented now:
- [x] Matrix data structure
- [x] Element-wise activations, and Softmax
- [x] MSE loss
- [x] Simple SGD and Backpropagation algorithm
- [x] Sequential DNN models
- [x] Gaussian and Uniform weight initializer
- [x] Saving and loading sequential models
- [x] Train and Test loop on MNIST, 1 model to load (0.83 accuracy)
- [x] Dropout Layer

# To Do:
- [ ] Batching : BatchedSGD, BatchNorm Layer
- [ ] Momentum SGD
- [ ] Learning rate scheduling
- [ ] Train MNIST autoencoder
- [ ] Autoencoder visualization UI
- [ ] Implement other non-DL ML techniques: 
  - [ ] KNN
  - [ ] PCA
  - [ ] SVM
