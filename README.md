# JAVA-ML
Implementing a small ML and DL library in pure java from scratch.

# Implemented now:
- Matrix data structure
- Element-wise activations
- MSE loss
- Simple SGD and Backpropagation algorithm
- Sequential DNN models
- Gaussian weight initializer

# To Do:
- Data loading and batching into matrices (example with MNIST)
- mini-batch sgd
- Clean training loop
- Other activations that are not element-wise (i.e softmax)
- Other losses (i.e crossentropy)
- Refactor activations using Java functional interface
- Implement other non-DL ML techniques: KNN, PCA, SVM's, etc..
