# JAVA-ML
Implementing a small ML and DL library in pure java from scratch.

# Implemented now:
- Matrix data structure
- Element-wise activations
- MSE loss
- Simple SGD and Backpropagation algorithm
- Sequential DNN models
- Gaussian and Uniform weight initializer
- Saving and loading sequential models
- Train and Test loop on MNIST, 1 model to load (0.754 accuracy)

# To Do:
- Batching
- Batched SGD
- Other activations that are not element-wise (i.e softmax)
- Other losses (i.e crossentropy)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Refactor activations using Java functional interface
- Train MNIST autoencoder
- Implement other non-DL ML techniques: KNN, PCA, SVM's, etc..
